## 📦 Purpose of This Repository

**`verdantprotocol-nodes`** contains the firmware and configuration logic for the distributed sensor nodes in the VerdantProtocol network. These nodes are built using Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontrollers and are responsible for collecting environmental data and publishing it to the master controller via MQTT.

Each node is modular and may include one or more sensors such as:

- 🌱 Soil moisture
- 🌡️ Temperature and humidity
- 🌬️ Barometric pressure
- 💡 Ambient light
- 🧪 pH and EC sensors
- 🌫️ CO₂ and air quality
